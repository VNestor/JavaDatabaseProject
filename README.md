# Student Database Project
## Description
I have built this Student Database project to gain familiarity with SQL databases using Java.
It is a CRUD application that has the ability to:
- enroll a new/transferring student into a database.
- update a student's information.
- delete a student in the database.

## Examples

### Searching for a student

### Display all students

### Add a student

### Update a student

### Delete a student
